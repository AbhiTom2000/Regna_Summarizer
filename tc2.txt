IN YOUR CAPACITY AS AN AUTHORIZED USER, ASANA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICE, WHICH IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE
To use the Service and Websites you must be, and you represent and warrant that you are, at least 16 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms. If the law where you reside requires that you must be older in order for Asana to lawfully provide the Service and Websites to you and use your personal data without parental consent, then you must be that older age. If the representations in the preceding sentence are not true, or if Asana has previously prohibited you from accessing or using the Service and Websites, you may not access or use the Service and Websites. To access the Service and Websites, you must register for an Asana account by creating a username and password. If you are a workspace or organization owner or administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a workspace or organization (“Account Administrator”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and agree that Asana is entitled to rely on your instructions. Asana will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred by Asana or a third party due to someone else using your account. In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer loses access to an account or otherwise requests information about an account, Asana reserves the right to request from the Account Administrator or Customer any verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account in its sole discretion.
